This repository contains the C++ programs developed as part of my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) Elective** coursework.

The programs progress from basic C++ programming concepts to classes, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and exception handling. Each `Class_X` folder contains programs covered or practised during the corresponding class/session.

## 💻 Programming Language

**C++**

The programs use standard C++ features and headers such as:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
```

Some programs also use `string` and other standard-library features.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **C++**
- **GCC / G++ compiler**
- **Code::Blocks**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Git**
- **GitHub**

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### Option 1: Run using Code::Blocks

The programs can be compiled and executed using **Code::Blocks** with a configured C++ compiler.

1. Open **Code::Blocks**.
2. Go to **File → Open** and select the required `.cpp` file.
3. If Code::Blocks asks for a compiler, select/configure the installed **GCC / MinGW** compiler.
4. Click **Build and Run** or press:

```text
F9
```

5. The program output will appear in the console window.

For example, open `Programs/Class_1/prog_1.cpp` and choose **Build → Build and Run**.

> **Note:** Most programs are standalone `.cpp` files and can be opened and run individually. Some files are intentionally kept as intermediate examples and may require correction before they compile successfully.

### Option 2: Run using Visual Studio Code

Open the repository folder in Visual Studio Code and compile a program using G++:

```bash
g++ Programs/Class_1/prog_1.cpp -o program
```

Run the compiled program on Windows:

```bash
program.exe
```

Or, depending on the terminal:

```bash
./program
```

Replace the source-file path with the `.cpp` file you want to execute.

### Option 3: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/king-3333333/OOPS_Elective_Programs.git
```

Then open the cloned folder in **Code::Blocks**, **Visual Studio Code**, or another C++ IDE.

## 📸 Screenshots / Errors

The `Screenshots of errors` folder may contain screenshots related to errors encountered while developing and testing the programs. These are included as part of the learning and debugging process.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Some programs are preserved in their original coursework/practice form, including intermediate attempts and examples with errors.
- The README describes the intent of each program based on the source files; it does not imply that every program compiles without modification.
- Review the comments in each `.cpp` file for additional context.
- The repository is intended for **coursework, learning, practice, and revision of C++ OOPS concepts**.
